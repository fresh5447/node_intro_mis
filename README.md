### Introduction To Node

Learning node by doing, and keeping track of it with github

----
#### First Commit
Using the node module `http`, to create a very simple node server. Run `node server.js` to start a server on port 3000.
```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response){
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  response.end('Hello world!')
}).listen(3000);

console.log("Server is listening on PORT 3000");
```
__and then we committed our code__

`git add -A`

`git commit -m "configured basic server using HTTP"`

`git push origin master`

----
#### Second Commit
We are making our project a node project by adding a `package.json` file.

Run command `npm init` to create the JSON file.

Next, we installed the NPM package `express`

Run command `npm install --save express`

*the dash dash save, writes express to our package.json*

1) Imported express and used the constructor to make our app.
2) Defined an endpoint `howdy`, which gives a response of some text.
3) Created a server on PORT 3000

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/howdy', function(req, res){
  res.end("We made it!");
});

var server = app.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log('Server ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ed up on PORT 3000');
});
```
then we committed our code

`git add -A`

`git commit -m "Add package.json, user express to configure our server"`

`git push origin master`

----
#### Third Commit
Up until now we have to kill our server, and restart our server to see our new changes in our code. We can use a tool called `nodemon`, that will make this process much easier.

`sudo npm install -g nodemon`

*the dash g flag tells NPM to install nodemon globally on our computer. Meaning it is not specific to this project. When install things globally, it's a pretty big deal, we need to prefix the command with sudo*

Now we can start our serve with `nodemon` and our server will automatically restart every time we save our codebase.

`nodemon server.js`

1) Make two new endpoints, one that serves a sad response, and one that serves a happy response.

```
app.get('/cheer', function(req, res){
  res.end("Its a beautiful day!!");
});

app.get('/jeer', function(req, res){
  res.end("Its a beautiful day!! -U2");
});
```

2) Commit your code. *we will no longer detail the steps for a commit*
